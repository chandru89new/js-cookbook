# JS Cookbook

**Note: This is a work in progress.**

This is a cookbook of recipes that I use (or have used) across multiple JS/TS projects.

1. Try-Catch made simpler
2. Promise.then.catch.finally made simpler
3. Extracting keys from a list of objects
4. Flattening an object
5. Piping through functions
6. Going from Array<Promise<Value>> to Promise<Array<Value>> when doing parallel promises
7. Piping through throwing functions that can throw
8. Safe, simple, sequential promises
9. Advanced switch-case a.k.a Pattern Matching
